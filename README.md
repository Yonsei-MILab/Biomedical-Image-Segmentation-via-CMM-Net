# Proposed CMM-Net: Contextual Multi-Scale Multi-Level Network

An end-to-end deep learning network called CMM-Net is designed for medical image segmentation. The proposed method is validated with three different medical imaging tasks and performed state-of-the-art performance.

# Python Code

We make the source code publicly available for researchers for validation and further improvement.
The code includes the following files: main, train, predict, and model's network.
