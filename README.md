# Proposed Recurrent Multi-Scale Pyramid Pooling-based U-Net (RMSPP-UNet)

An end-to-end deep learning network called RMSPP-UNET is designed for medical image segmentation. The proposed method is validated with three different medical imaging tasks and performed state-of-the-art performance.

# Python Code

we make the source code publicly available for researchers for validation and further improvement.
The code includes the following files: main, train, predict, and model's network.

# Our Submitted paper

The paper entitled: "Recurrent Multi-Scale Pyramid Pooling Feature Fusion for Efficient Biomedical Image Segmentation" was submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.
